Two-Dimensional Cellular Automata
=================================

## Theory

[2D Cellular Automata](theory)

## Demo

###### Multi-Layer Multi-Range
- [Living Pattern](demo/living) of multi-range Turing Patterns using probablistic sampling
- [Turing Mccabe](demo/Turing_McCabe) Patterns using multi-level multi-range reaction diffusion.

###### Pseudo 3D Rendering
- [Turing Pattern Microscope](demo/microscope), a 3D Depth-Map Version of *Living Pattern*
- [Dawn of the Depth](demo/dawn_of_the_depth) shows how to create 3D Depth-Maps using a technique similar to ray-marching

###### Tools
- [Modulo Visualizer](demo/modulo_visualizer) is a little tool to visualize the different implementations of the Modulo Operator

## Exercise
- Create a totalistic CA for either the Neumann or the Moore Neighborhood
- Add user interaction to change the type of the neighborhood
- Extend your program so it can handle larger neighborhoods
