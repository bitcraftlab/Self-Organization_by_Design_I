[Cellular Automata and Beyond](theory)

## Demo

###### Asynchronous Updates
- [Flocking Blocks](demo/flocking_blocks) is a probablistic CA with asynchronous updates.
Blocks are only moved if the move does not result in a collision

###### Margolus Updates
- [Pixel Gas](demo/pixel_gas) automaton based on the Margolus Neighborhood.

###### Falling Sand
- [Sandbox](demo/sandbox) is a *tiny sketch* implementation of the *Falling Sand* genre.
See it in the repo or on OpenProcessing.
- [Sandglobe](demo/sandbowl) that uses probablistic rules to overcome *isotropy* of the rectangular grid. Grab the region outside the bowl and drag it to see the effect.

## Exercise

###### Continous Cellular Automata
- Create a Most-Elementary Continuos Automaton
- Extend your CA to larger neighborhoods
- Create a continuos CA that stabilizes 
- Create a continuous CA that goes all crazy
